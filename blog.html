        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">1.Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h1>
        <p>While let and const are block-scoped, var declarations are either globally scoped or function-scoped. Let variables can be updated but not re-declared, const variables cannot be updated or re-declared, and var variables may both be updated and re-declared inside their scope.</p>
        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">2.Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
        <p>The null value is a primitive value which represents the null, empty, or non-existent reference. The undefined value is a primitive value, which is used when a variable has not been assigned a value.</p>
        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">3.What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
        <p>A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.</p>
